        <h2>BUILDING</h2>
        <p>We now have a building with better connectivity along with other facilities. We sometimes feel like the science fiction movie is becoming a reality. Smart Buildings makes our life easier because it is equipped with smart technologies.</p><details><summary>...</summary><p>Security has increased to such a way that we now require badges to get into specific areas or building. Solar panels are used to produce electricity and smart meters for lower bills. Before, the buildings offered very basic services. The aim of smart building is to facilitate the life of their residents for a better living.We cannot measure the benefits of a Smart Building. iBMS, ‘i’ which stands for integration can disable the lift systems automatically in case of fire and opens emergency exits, ensuring the safety of the building’s occupants. The building adapt with all weather conditions and can monitor the heating system for energy savings. The overall aim is to reduce energy consumption and promote lifestyle.

            However, evolution does not provide 100% security. According to Memoori.com, a sudden development of smart devices has increased cyber-risk. Based on the research, an estimate of global revenues for Smart Building cyber security will reach $8.65 billion in 2021, which is costly. BBC world published a recent cyber attack in 2019, where more than half of British firms reported cyber-attacks.
            
            The cost is high to employ physical hardware, as well as perform necessary outfitting, construction etc in a smart building. Furthermore, outfitting IoT can raise cybersecurity risk that might alone deter companies from transforming their buildings.
            
            Another challenge is, understanding the scope of the Information Technology and Operations Technology integration.
            
            Furthermore, change of building automation, for instance, by introducing protocols like BACnet, but most of the building services are still operating as silos. The reason behind is the security fears. Also, contractors want to secure future maintenance revenues by the use of legacy systems with little transparency.

  <h4>Smart Building needs to take into account the following main points:</h4>
            <li> Precautions to be taken in a Smart Building</li>
           <li> Precautions to be taken in a Smart Building</li></ul>
            <h4>increasing visibility –</h4> it is important to note who is coming and leaving the network. We must also get a clear footprint of their status and activities. Visibility can spot misconfigurations, faults or anomalies that can lead to cyber attack. To prevent this we need to continuously monitor the network activities.

        <h2>ROAD</h2>
        <p>Visions like driverless cars and self-repairing concrete seem futuristic but we might very well see them soon becoming a common aspect of transport.I learned about how modern technology is changing roads and motorways.</p><details><summary>...</summary><p>A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or by some form of conveyance (including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse).

            Roads consist of one or two roadways (British English: carriageways), each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks (British English: pavement) and road verges. A bike path - a road for use by bicycles- may or may not parallel other roads.
            
            Other names for a road include: parkway; avenue; freeway, motorway or expressway; tollway; interstate; highway; thoroughfare; or primary, secondary, and tertiary local road.Historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance.[1]

            The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines a road as "a line of communication (travelled way) using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips open to public traffic, primarily for the use of road motor vehicles running on their own wheels", which includes "bridges, tunnels, supporting structures, junctions, crossings, interchanges, and toll roads, but not cycle paths".[2]
            
            The Eurostat, ITF and UNECE Glossary for Transport Statistics Illustrated defines a road as a "Line of communication (traveled way) open to public traffic, primarily for the use of road motor vehicles, using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips. [...] Included are paved roads and other roads with a stabilized base, e.g. gravel roads. Roads also cover streets, bridges, tunnels, supporting structures, junctions, crossings and interchanges. Toll roads are also included. Excluded are dedicated cycle lanes."[3]
            
            The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic defines a road as the entire surface of any way or street open to public traffic.[4]
            
            In urban areas roads may diverge through a city or village and be named as streets, serving a dual function as urban space easement and route.[5] Modern roads are normally smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel.[6]
            
            Australia
            See also: Highways in Australia
            Part 2, Division 1, clauses 11-13 of the National Transport Commission Road Transport Legislation 2006 defines a road in Australia as 'an area that is open to or used by the public and is developed for, or has as one of its main uses, the driving or riding of motor vehicles.'[7]
            
            Further, it defines a shoulder (typical an area of the road outside the edge line, or the kerb) and a road-related area which includes green areas separating roads, areas designated for cyclists and areas generally accessible to the public for driving, riding or parking vehicles.
            
            New Zealand
            In New Zealand, the definition of a road is broad in common law[8] where the statutory definition includes areas the public has access to, by right or not.[9] Beaches, publicly accessible car parks and yards (even if privately owned), river beds, road shoulders (verges), wharves and bridges are included.[10] However, the definition of a road for insurance purposes may be restricted to reduce risk.

            
            United States
            In the United States, laws distinguish between public roads, which are open to public use, and private roads, which are privately controlled.[17]

        <h2>BRIDGE</h2>
        <p>In the world of architecture, perhaps nothing is more utilitarian than a bridge.  valley, or road, without,designed to accommodate but unlike some skyscrapers and everyone has access to using a bridge.</p><br><details><summary>...</summary><p>

        A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle, such as a body of water, valley, or road, without closing the way underneath. It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it and the funds available to build it.

Most likely, the earliest bridges were fallen trees and stepping stones, while Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland. The Arkadiko Bridge dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese, in southern Greece is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.The simplest and earliest types of bridges were stepping stones. Neolithic people also built a form of boardwalk across marshes; examples of such bridges include the Sweet Track and the Post Track in England, approximately 6000 years old.[2] Undoubtedly, ancient people would also have used log bridges; that is a timber bridge[3] that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams. Some of the first man-made bridges with significant span were probably intentionally felled trees.[4]

Among the oldest timber bridges is the Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden crossing upper Lake Zürich in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the Seedamm date back to 1523 BC. The first wooden footbridge led across Lake Zürich, followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the Roman Empire built a 6-metre-wide (20 ft) wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 – measuring approximately 1,450 metres (4,760 ft) in length and 4 metres (13 ft) wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland.

The Arkadiko Bridge is one of four Mycenaean corbel arch bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate chariots, between the fort of Tiryns and town of Epidauros in the Peloponnese, in southern Greece. Dating to the Greek Bronze Age (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use. Several intact arched stone bridges from the Hellenistic era can be found in the Peloponnese.[5]

The greatest bridge builders of antiquity were the ancient Romans.[6] The Romans built arch bridges and aqueducts that could stand in conditions that would damage or destroy earlier designs. Some stand today.[7] An example is the Alcántara Bridge, built over the river Tagus, in Spain. The Romans also used cement, which reduced the variation of strength found in natural stone.[8] One type of cement, called pozzolana, consisted of water, lime, sand, and volcanic rock. Brick and mortar bridges were built after the Roman era, as the technology for cement was lost (then later rediscovered).

In India, the Arthashastra treatise by Kautilya mentions the construction of dams and bridges.</p>
